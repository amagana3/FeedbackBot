"""
Problem: When someone wants feedback we should make sure they have given feedback to the previous feedback track.
Solution:
    When someone submits a new feedback (link or appropriate format), check to see the previous user's feedback.
    See if current user (submitter) has given feedback to previous person.
    IF they have
        Good! We can allow track to post.
    ELSE they have not
        Then we decline the feedback, and tell them to give feedback to previous user.
